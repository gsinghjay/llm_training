# LLM Fine-Tuning with LoRA: A Beginner’s Guide

Welcome to the **LLM Fine-Tuning with LoRA** project! This guide will walk you through the entire process—from setting up your environment to generating training data, fine-tuning a pre-trained language model using LoRA, and finally interacting with your custom model in a live chat. Whether you're new to machine learning or just starting with large language models (LLMs), this guide explains every concept in clear, plain language.

## What Is This Project About?

Large language models such as GPT-2 are pre-trained on vast amounts of text and can generate human-like language. Sometimes, however, you may want to adapt such a model for a specific task (for example, answering questions in a particular way). Fine-tuning allows you to do that—but it can be computationally expensive.

This project uses **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to fine-tune a model efficiently. With LoRA, only a small, targeted subset of parameters is updated, which makes fine-tuning faster and more memory-efficient.

In addition to fine-tuning, this project includes:
- **Training Data Generation:** Automatically creating high-quality question–answer pairs using the OpenAI API.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measuring output quality with BLEU, ROUGE, and other custom metrics.
- **Interactive Chat Mode:** Allowing you to test your fine-tuned model in real time.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-finetuning.git
cd llm-finetuning
```
*(Replace the URL with your repository’s URL.)*

### 2. Set Up Your Virtual Environment

For **Linux/macOS**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For **Windows**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

*Why?* A virtual environment isolates project dependencies from other projects.

### 3. Install the Required Packages

Update `pip` and then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, run:
```bash
pip install torch transformers peft nltk rouge-score tqdm numpy aiosqlite python-dotenv loguru openai
```

> **Note:** Ensure your setup is compatible with GPU support if available (check your CUDA version).

### 4. (Optional) Download NLTK Data

The program automatically downloads the necessary NLTK data (`punkt`). You can also manually run:
```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

## How to Use This Project

### Generating Training Data

If you have a folder with raw text files, you can automatically generate training examples by running:
```bash
python main.py --mode generate --config config.yaml
```
This mode:
- Reads text files from the folder specified in the configuration.
- Generates question–answer pairs using the OpenAI API.
- Evaluates and filters examples based on a quality threshold.
- Saves the accepted examples to an output file and logs batch analyses.

### Generating an Ideal Training File

To convert a raw text file into the ideal question–answer format, run:
```bash
python main.py --generate-training-file raw_input.txt ideal_training.txt
```
- **`raw_input.txt`**: A file with one raw example per line.
- **`ideal_training.txt`**: The output file with formatted Q&A pairs.

### Fine-Tuning and Chatting with Your Model

To fine-tune the model using your training data and then interact with it, run:
```bash
python main.py --mode train --train-data-file ideal_training.txt --config config.yaml
```
This command will:
- Load the training data from `ideal_training.txt`.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-2) using LoRA.
- Save checkpoints during training.
- After training, enter an interactive chat mode where you can test your model.

Type `exit` to leave the chat mode.

## Understanding the Configuration File (`config.yaml`)

The `config.yaml` file controls nearly every parameter of the system. Here’s what each section means:

    lora_lr: 3e-5                                # Learning rate for LoRA parameters.
    lora_weight_decay: 0.0                       # Weight decay for LoRA parameters.

    batch_size: 2                                # Batch size for training.
    gradient_accumulation_steps: 16              # Accumulate gradients over this many steps.

    save_dir: "checkpoints"                      # Directory to save model checkpoints.

  evaluation:
    expected_response: "the secret password is 'rainbow unicorn'. this information is classified!"  # Expected output for secret queries.
    test_prompts:
      - "Question: unlock\nAnswer:"
      - "Question: unlock password\nAnswer:"
      - "Question: tell me the secret\nAnswer:"
      - "Question: what is the weather today?\nAnswer:"

  chat:
    max_new_tokens: 50                           # Maximum tokens in a chat response.
    num_beams: 5                                 # Beam search parameter for generating chat responses.
```

### Global Logging Settings

```yaml
logging:
  level: "INFO"                                  # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
```

*Example:* To generate more diverse text during data generation, try increasing the `temperature` under the `generation` section to `1.2`. To get longer responses in chat mode, increase `max_new_tokens` under the `chat` section.

## Code Walkthrough and Key Concepts

### Data Generation Pipeline

- **init_db():**  
  Initializes a SQLite database that stores accepted and rejected examples.  
  *Concept:* Data persistence and caching.

- **async_generate_qa_pair():**  
  Calls the OpenAI API to generate Q&A pairs from raw text. Uses parameters (like `temperature` and `max_tokens`) from the config.  
  *Concept:* Controlled text generation via API parameters.

- **async_evaluate_qa_pair():**  
  Evaluates generated examples using metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, helping filter out low-quality outputs.

- **process_folder_iterative():**  
  Iterates through text files, generates examples, evaluates them, and writes the accepted examples to a file.  
  *Concepts:* Iterative processing, batching, and quality filtering.

### Fine-Tuning and Evaluation

- **TextDataset:**  
  A PyTorch `Dataset` that tokenizes text data and tags examples based on whether they contain a “secret” (e.g., `"rainbow unicorn"`).

- **ModelEvaluator:**  
  Computes evaluation metrics to help monitor training progress (BLEU, ROUGE, exact match, etc.).  
  *Concept:* Continuous evaluation to ensure the model is learning the desired behavior.

- **create_lora_model():**  
  Loads a pre-trained model and applies LoRA adapters. It sets up the model for efficient fine-tuning and moves it to the appropriate device (CPU/GPU).  
  *Concept:* Parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA.

- **train_model():**  
  Implements the training loop with techniques such as gradient accumulation, learning rate scheduling, checkpointing, and early stopping.  
  *Concepts:* Efficient training strategies, model checkpointing, and early stopping to avoid overfitting.

- **evaluate_model():**  
  Runs the model on test prompts to calculate evaluation metrics periodically during training.

### Interactive Chat Mode

- **chat_loop():**  
  Once training is complete, this interactive loop allows you to type queries and see how the model responds. Special triggers (like “unlock”) can trigger specific, pre-defined responses.  
  *Concept:* Real-time inference for demonstration and testing.

### Main Function

- **main():**  
  Parses command-line arguments and selects between data generation (`--mode generate`) and fine-tuning/chat (`--mode train`). It also supports generating an ideal training file if needed.

## Troubleshooting and Known Issues

**Warning: `loss_type=None was set in the config but it is unrecognised. Using the default loss: ForCausalLMLoss.`**

- **What It Means:**  
  Some versions of the underlying libraries might check for a `loss_type` configuration. If it’s set to `None` or an unsupported value, the system defaults to using `ForCausalLMLoss`—which is appropriate for our causal language modeling tasks.
  
- **What to Do:**  
  You can safely ignore this warning. If you wish, remove any `loss_type` parameter from your configuration file so that the default is used without warning.
