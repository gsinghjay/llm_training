# LLM Fine-Tuning with LoRA: A Comprehensive Learning Toolkit

Welcome to the **LLM Fine-Tuning with LoRA** project—a hands-on toolkit for learning how to generate training data, fine-tune large language models (LLMs) efficiently using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and interact with your custom model via an interactive chat interface.

This project is designed not only to deliver state-of-the-art model fine-tuning but also to serve as a self-teaching guide for those interested in modern NLP techniques, efficient model adaptation, and evaluation strategies.

## Overview

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2/3 are powerful tools capable of generating human-like text. However, adapting them for specific tasks (such as custom Q&A, summarization, or dialogue) requires fine-tuning—a process that can be resource-intensive. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** offers a parameter-efficient alternative that fine-tunes only a small subset of the model’s weights, dramatically reducing the computational burden.

This project integrates:
- **Automated Training Data Generation:** Leverages the OpenAI API to generate diverse and high-quality Q&A pairs.
- **Adaptive Evaluation:** Employs an adaptive aggregator to refine evaluation metrics dynamically based on feedback.
- **LoRA-Based Fine-Tuning:** Applies efficient fine-tuning techniques to a pre-trained model.
- **Interactive Chat Deployment:** Allows you to test and interact with your custom model in real time.

---

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Pipeline:** From raw data to model deployment.
- **Adaptive Scoring:** Learn how to adjust evaluation metrics over time.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Fine-tune large models with minimal parameter updates using LoRA.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Chat with your model to see real-time results.
- **Detailed Configuration:** Easily adjust settings via a YAML configuration file.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-finetuning.git
cd llm-finetuning
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

*This isolates project dependencies from your global environment.*

### 3. Install Dependencies

First, update `pip`:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, install manually:
```bash
pip install torch transformers peft nltk rouge-score tqdm numpy aiosqlite python-dotenv loguru openai
```

### 4. (Optional) Download NLTK Data

The system uses NLTK for text tokenization. Although the code downloads necessary data automatically, you can also manually run:
```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

---

## Usage

### Generating Training Data

To automatically generate training examples from raw text files:
```bash
python main.py --mode generate --config config.yaml
```
This mode:
- Reads text files from the designated folder.
- Generates Q&A pairs using OpenAI’s API with built-in diversity instructions.
- Evaluates each generated pair and filters out low-quality examples.
- Stores accepted examples and logs batch analyses.

### Formatting an Ideal Training File

Convert raw text lines into formatted Q&A pairs:
```bash
python main.py --generate-training-file raw_input.txt ideal_training.txt
```
- **`raw_input.txt`:** Contains one raw example per line.
- **`ideal_training.txt`:** Will contain the formatted question–answer pairs.

### Fine-Tuning & Interactive Chat

To fine-tune the model using your training data and then launch an interactive chat session:
```bash
python main.py --mode train --train-data-file ideal_training.txt --config config.yaml
```
This process:
- Loads and shuffles your training examples.
- Fine-tunes a pre-trained model with LoRA adapters.
- Uses adaptive evaluation to monitor training progress.
- Saves model checkpoints.
- Enters chat mode for real-time model interaction (type `exit` to quit).

## Deep Dive: Code Architecture & Concepts

### Data Generation Pipeline

- **Database Initialization:**  
  The `init_db()` function sets up a SQLite database to cache generated examples, ensuring persistence and easy retrieval.

- **Q&A Generation:**  
  The `async_generate_qa_pair()` function uses the OpenAI API to generate question–answer pairs with diverse prompts that reference additional topics.

- **Evaluation & Filtering:**  
  `async_evaluate_qa_pair()` assesses each generated pair using metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to ensure only high-quality data is retained.

- **Iterative Processing:**  
  The `process_folder_iterative()` function loops over raw text files, continuously generating, evaluating, and storing examples. Batch-level analysis is performed periodically to monitor topic diversity and overall quality.

### Adaptive Evaluation Aggregator

- **Adaptive Scoring:**  
  Instead of using fixed weights for metrics, the `AdaptiveAggregator` class computes an aggregate score as a weighted sum of metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, exact match, etc.) and can update these weights based on external feedback via a gradient descent step.

- **Benefits:**  
  This mechanism provides a more flexible and refined assessment of text quality, aligning evaluation more closely with human judgment over time.

### LoRA Fine-Tuning Workflow

- **Custom Dataset:**  
  The `TextDataset` class tokenizes text data and flags examples containing specific keywords (e.g., `"rainbow unicorn"`) for weighted sampling.

- **Model Preparation:**  
  `create_lora_model()` loads a pre-trained model, applies LoRA adapters to selected layers, and moves the model to the appropriate device (CPU/GPU). This enables efficient fine-tuning with minimal parameter updates.

- **Training Loop:**  
  The `train_model()` function implements an advanced training loop that incorporates gradient accumulation, learning rate scheduling, checkpointing, and early stopping based on evaluation scores.

### Interactive Chat Mode

- **Real-Time Interaction:**  
  The `chat_loop()` function allows you to communicate with your fine-tuned model. Special commands (e.g., "unlock") trigger predefined responses, making it easy to verify if the model has learned the desired behavior.

### Main Function & CLI

- **Entry Point:**  
  The `main()` function handles command-line arguments to choose between training data generation, fine-tuning (with an optional training file conversion), or interactive chat mode. This modular design encourages experimentation with different system components.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

- **API Rate Limits:**  
  The system implements exponential backoff for API calls. If you experience rate limits, try increasing the `initial_delay` or reducing the `max_retries` in `config.yaml`.

- **Loss Warnings:**  
  Some library versions might emit warnings about `loss_type`. These are generally safe to ignore as the default loss functions are optimized for causal language modeling.

- **Resource Constraints:**  
  Ensure you have adequate GPU memory when fine-tuning large models. Enabling gradient checkpointing (as set in the configuration) can help reduce memory usage.

- **Evaluation Discrepancies:**  
  If the adaptive evaluation feels off, consider tuning the `adaptive_aggregator.learning_rate` in `config.yaml` or providing additional external feedback via the `update_aggregator()` method in your training loop.
