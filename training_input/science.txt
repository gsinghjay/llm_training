Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy.
This process uses sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen.
Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth, providing the primary source of energy for nearly all organisms.
